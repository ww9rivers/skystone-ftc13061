# FTC Robot Mechanics

Documented here are basic mechanical units / modules that make up the robot.

## Drive Motors

Team 13061 currently owns two types of DC motors suitable for driving the robot: REV Hex HD motors,
by REV Robotics, and Tetrix DC motors, from PITSCO.  

### REV Hex HD Motors

* Encoder: These motors have built-in encoders.

### Tetrix DC Motors

* Encoder: Two of these motors have add-on encoders. These add-on encoders are fairly expensive.

## Servos

Team 13061 owns two types of servos: REV and Tetrix.

### REV Continuous Servos

* These servos can run continuously.

### Tetrix Servos

* These servos have a range of 0 to 180 degrees.

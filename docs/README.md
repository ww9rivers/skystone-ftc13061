# README

The FTC13061 folder contains code, resources, and documents developed by the FIRST Robotics team 13061,
the Ann-Hua Robotics (a.k.a. Pigs Will Fly).

## Pi Based Team Server

We can build a Pi (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, etc.) based team server for the field work.
The server would provide these services to the team in a field of competition, where
Wi-Fi may not be readily available.

### Git Server

This would allow a team to collaborate actively, even in the field. No more copying using USB
key drive will be necessary, while keeping everyone's work in sync.

### Wi-Fi Hotspot

A team may bring a Wi-Fi router into the field. But the server will be able to serve as
a Wi-Fi router at the same time.

The hotspot may use a wireless back-haul to link up to the Internet when necessary.

### Scouting Server

Even though at the FTC level scouting is limited, this still could be a useful tool.
At the FRC level, this would be even more practical.

### Presentation Server

A service that allows team activities be actively presented during competition. Team members
and supporters may take photos and videos, upload them in near real time to the presentation
server to be shown _live_ in the field.

### Inventory Server

Added bonus.

## Implementation

Implementation details

### Battery Charged Operation

The entire server may run on a battery for an extended period of time (i.e. 30 minutes at least) to
allow it to be mobile and to operate uninterrupted while moving around.
